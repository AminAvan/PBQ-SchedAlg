# A Task Scheduler for Mobile Edge Computing Using Priority-based Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
We propose a Q-learning (QL)-based task scheduling algorithm (named PBQ) for edge users who offload their tasks to edge servers.

We prioritize tasks from edge users based on their deadlines, inspired by the EDF approach, where tasks with the closest deadlines are given the highest priority in PBQ.
